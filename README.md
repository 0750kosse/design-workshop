## Excercise 1 - Help Dmitri plan his new CV

Dmitri has decided to apply for a new job. The jobs he's looking at are:

- Antiques dealer
- Rave DJ
- Academic
- Photographer
- Circus performer
- Outdoorsman
- Womens fashion blogger
- Surgeon
- Travel writer
- Software Engineer

It's your job to make sure his CV is looking top notch. Based on the design language of your chosen career, sketch out and decide on a layout for Dmitri's new online CV.

## Exercise 2 - apply your styles to the web

You're going to turn this vision into an online typographic digital CV page.

1. Find the `cv.html` and `cv.css` files
2. Change the name in the `cv.html` file to your own (and feel free to add your own details!)
3. Using https://type-scale.com/ and google fonts, choose a font pairing and hierarchy for your CV
4. Edit the spacing values to give the CV room to breathe
5. Use https://colorbook.me/ to choose a set of colours

You have about an hour to make this vision come true.

## Excercise 3 - make his new CV look good on mobile

Now you're going to make your CV look good on mobile and desktop.

1. Use https://www.surge.sh to push your CV to your own static website
2. On your phone, have a look at your CV. Oops!
3. Make your website look good on mobile using your `cv.css` file
3. Find the `responsive.css` file and using the desktop breakpoint, add the classes you need to return your desktop cv to its former glory
