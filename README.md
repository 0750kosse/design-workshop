Colour

Layout (golden ratio?)

Grids, White space and rhythm

## Exercise 1 (~90 minutes)

You're going to create a typographic digital CV page for yourself that reflects your personality and values.

1. Find the `cv.html` and `cv.css` files
2. Change the name in the `cv.html` file to your own (and feel free to add your own details!)
3. Using https://type-scale.com/ and google fonts, choose a font pairing and hierarchy for your CV
4. Edit the spacing values to give the CV room to breathe
5. Use https://colorbook.me/ to choose a set of colours

## Section 3: Design for screens

Responsive web

Web vs apps


## Excercise 2 (~90 minutes)

Now you're going to make your CV look good on mobile and desktop.

1. Use https://www.surge.sh to push your CV to your own static website
2. On your phone, have a look at your CV. Oops!
3. Make your website look good on mobile using your `cv.css` file
3. Find the `responsive.css` file and using the desktop breakpoint, add the classes you need to return your desktop cv to its former glory
